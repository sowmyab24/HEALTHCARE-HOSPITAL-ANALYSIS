# HEALTHCARE-HOSPITAL-ANALYSIS

This project simulates a **Hospital Management System** database using SQL. It demonstrates the ability to design normalized schemas, write complex queries, and generate healthcare insights using real-world logic.
Welcome to the Hospital Management SQL Project  a real-world healthcare database modeled in SQL. 
# This project simulates hospital operations and enables analytical insights through practical SQL queries (Easy, Medium, and Hard levels).

# KEY METRICS & BUSINESS IMPACTS
This project empowers hospitals to make data-informed decisions, improve patient outcomes, optimize operations, and reduce costs.
1. # Patient Demographics & Data Cleanup
Example: Ordering patients by name length, filtering out 'NKA' and NULL in allergies.

Impact:
Helps in data quality improvement, which is vital for accurate reporting, analytics, and compliance with healthcare regulations like HIPAA.
 
2. # Gender-Based Statistics
Example: Showing male vs. female patient counts in a single row.

Impact:
Supports gender-specific care programs, resource planning (e.g., maternity vs. general care), and equitable healthcare delivery.

3. # Allergy & Diagnosis Analysis
Example: Filtering for patients allergic to 'Penicillin' or 'Morphine', finding repeated diagnoses.

Impact:
Enables personalized patient care and helps in risk management by tracking recurrent issues or drug sensitivities.
   
4. # City/Region Level Reports
Example: Count of patients by city, sorting by patient volume.

Impact:
Aids in hospital expansion strategies, regional staffing, and mobile health outreach programs.

5. # Date-Based Admission Trends
Example: Admissions per day, admissions in the 1970s.

Impact:
Helps reduce billing errors, improves data integrity, and ensures complete patient tracking.

6. # Advanced Data Transformation
Example: Converting CM to feet, KG to pounds, showing formatted full names.

Impact:
Supports global compatibility (imperial vs. metric), improves data readability for frontline staff and dashboards.

7. # Duplicate & Missing Records Detection
Example: Finding duplicates and patients without admissions.

Impact:
Helps reduce billing errors, improves data integrity, and ensures complete patient tracking.


8. # Complex Conditions with Logic
Example: Combining multiple criteria for filtering patient-doctor records.

Impact:
Enhances targeted query building for advanced clinical investigations and internal audits.
